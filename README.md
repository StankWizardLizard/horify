# horify

horify is a work-in-progress tool to automate the setup of custom icons for the Nintendo switch [horify-theme](https://github.com/StankWizardLizard/cartify-theme)

## Getting Started

Before we can get started with using this tool you need to make sure you have dumped your titles from your swith into a titles.csv file

```

0100A3D008C5C000|Pokémon Scarlet
01007EF00011E000|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

This tool is reliant on two other tools [sys-tweak](https://sodasoba1.github.io/sys-tweak/) and [nx-titles-list-dumper](https://github.com/HamletDuFromage/nx-titles-list-dumper), make sure you are well informed on these other tools before continuing.
